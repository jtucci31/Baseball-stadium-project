Cannot figure out how to web scrape this just yet. I've scraped the html file pretty easily, but its structure
is very confusing to me right now.

Elizabeth helped me copy the JSON format from the HTML file, and used a JSON cleaner to get it formatted correctly.

Most data I want from the JSON has been taken out and put into a CSV. The only thing I need to fix still is the one column with inspections that has two in one.



Finished data file: ESPN_stadium_violations.CSV
