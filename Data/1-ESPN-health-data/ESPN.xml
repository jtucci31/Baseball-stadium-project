<h2 class="type-sans uppercase ta-c fz36">About the project</h2>

<p class="fz15">ESPN's Outside the Lines reviewed and collected more than 16,000 food-safety inspection reports from health departments that monitor the 111 professional football, baseball, basketball and hockey facilities across North America. The review of routine inspection reports from 2016 and 2017 found that at about 28 percent of the venues,  half or more of the food service outlets incurred a high-level violation -- one that poses a potential threat for foodborne illness. Outside the Lines also calculated the average number of high-level violations per inspection at each venue, and compared that to the average for restaurants and other food outlets in the surrounding area, for the 82 venues for which we had community data provided by Hazel Analytics. Find your favorite stadium to determine how many high-level violations were found, how the stadium's inspection results compare to other eateries in the surrounding community, and notable samples of our findings. <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/25499595/health-inspection-reports-find-violations-nfl-nhl-nba-mlb-stadiums-cause-foodborne-illness-2018-espn-lines" target="_blank">Read the full story</a>.</p>

<p class="fz15">Local health departments typically use a version of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Food Code, or comparable rules in Canada, to define food-safety violations; however, classifications of the severity of violations can vary among jurisdictions. For example, sometimes the same violation can be high level in one spot but not in another due to how pervasive it is -- a dead roach under a sink could be considered a low-level violation while live cockroaches crawling around popcorn can be a high-level violation. And some jurisdictions might simply designate certain violations as posing more, or less, of a risk to public health.</p>
