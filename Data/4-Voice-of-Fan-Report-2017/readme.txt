I was able to simply copy and paste the big table of data, but I may want to go back and get more
data from each individual team. Which may actually be the same data from the table, just in a different format.

Cleaning this data may take a minute, to get it to be legible and easily understoood for future use.

Hard to web scrape, cannot figure out at all.
