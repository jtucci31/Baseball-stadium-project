I was able to simply copy and paste the big table of data, but I may want to go back and get more
data from each individual team. Which may actually be the same data from the table, just in a different format.

Cleaning this data may take a minute, to get it to be legible and easily understoood for future use.

Hard to web scrape, cannot figure out at all.


Copy and pasted the contents from the table within the webpage right into a CSV and worked from there.
