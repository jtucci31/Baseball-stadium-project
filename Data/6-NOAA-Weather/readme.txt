weather data is in form of CSV. All json or xml files can largely be ignored.

These datasets are in a 6 month range from May-October (baseball season)


Changed cities:
Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN changed to Minneapolis, Minnesota
La Guardia, NY changed to Queens, NY (for Mets Citi Field)
Central Park, NY changed to Bronx, NY (for Yankee Stadium)
Reagan National Airport changed to Washington, District of Columbia
St. Petersburg, FL changed to Tampa, FL


Missing weather data was compiled from the same source, but by looking at the county level. I was able to find 2017 data for the same 6-month May-October span of time, and added that into my two CSV's. This data then had a 1901-2010 average, which my other two CSV's did not have, so I had to get that 2918-2010 average. Those files are saved in the Missing Cities folder to document that I got that information and then had to get the average weather and precipitation.
